# Web-Development-Projects
This is a collection of web development mini-projects I am working on to improve my html, css, and js skills. The projects are listed below with a short description. All the projects are from an Udemy course "50 Projects in 50 Days". This first repository will cover projects 1-25. 

Project List
1. Expanding Cards- This project has 5 panels of photos when you click on one it expands out. Some added functionality will be to have compress on click after I finish commmenting on it.
